An attempt at conciliation</h3>Sophie Passmann is a feminist and doesn't agree at all with the stereotype that old white men are to blame for everything. The "old white man" is a cliché associated with previledge and power in the german language. Sophie Passmann interviews famous male politicians, actors, chefs, comedians, artists and wants to know what is behind this cliché. In her interviews, she asks provocative questions and wants to hear the other side of the story. It is supposed to be an attempt at conciliation.</div>
