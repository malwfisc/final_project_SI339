# use-git-malwfisc

This is a project for SI339.
I plan to share audiobooks and books which I would recommend. The project should include html and advanced css.
All works exist as audiobook and book, but I prefer to put them on seperate pages for styling purposes and based on how I accessed them.
Some works only exist in german.
